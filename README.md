## The Interface
The 2023 is the year when many people start running LLMs on consumer HW. This begins the need for a new operation system with LLM at the core.   

At a higher level, you can think about it as a triangle between CPU - Human - LLM. SkyAlt is not about these 3 parts. SkyAlt invents the edges. CPU - Human "bridge" is pretty solid after a few decades of innovations, but the other 2 are unexplored. 

In the context of this article, CPU doesn't mean HW, but instructions, which can be executed billions of times every second. LLM or the human brain will never be as fast and efficient in a task like the sum() of 1B numbers. LLM is the digital brain and CPU is muscle. Both have an important place in the future of computing.

SkyAlt interface takes inspiration from spreadsheet grid & formulas and node based graphs.



## The Ecosystem
The amount of AI progress is hard to describe. LLM is the new programming paradigm, which evolves weekly from white papers over demos into products. True wild, wild west.

One of the most important SkyAlt missions is to bring in new models and implementations as quickly as possible. SkyAlt is a new product, so developers will not implement their code into SkyAlt. But they can add our small SDK into their programs with minimum effort. Programs then connects to SkyAlt where they are represented as nodes with settings. Nodes can be composed together to create a high range of customized apps.



## Local first
Most of today's apps run in a browser as Software as a Service. Here's the list of problems you may experience:
- delay between client and server
- none or simple export
- hard to migrate between clouds
- data disappear(music playlist, etc.)
- data was tampered
- new SaaS version was released and you wanna keep using the older one
- no offline mode
- SaaS shut down
- price goes up
- 3rd party can access your data

SkyAlt solves them with Local-first computing. The biggest advantages can be summarized as:
- quick responses
- works offline
- ownership
- privacy(E2EE everywhere)
- works 'forever' + run any version

For endurance, SkyAlt uses only well-known and open formats:
- SQLite for storages
- Json for settings
